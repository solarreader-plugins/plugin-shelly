# Shelly Plugin for Solarreader

This plugin for Solarreader reads values from shelly devices.

It can also send commands (device-dependent) to turn on, turn off, toggle, open, or close, and in roller mode, set the
position from 0 to 100% in steps of 10.

The plugin requires the main project Solarreader-core, which can be found here:
https://github.com/solarreader-core/solarreader
